1.Real-World Application: Sensor Placement in IoT Networks\
The problem focuses on efficient sensor placement in smart city IoT networks, modeled as a graph where nodes are sensors and edges are\ communication links. The goal is to select a minimal set of sensors covering all links, formulated as a Minimum Vertex Cover Problem.\ Three algorithms—Greedy 2-approximation, LP-relaxation, and Randomized heuristic—are compared on synthetic networks in terms of sensor count,\ execution time, and coverage, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy and speed.\
