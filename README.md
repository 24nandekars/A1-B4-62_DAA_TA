1.Real-World Application: Sensor Placement in IoT Networks\
The problem focuses on efficient sensor placement in smart city IoT networks, modeled as a graph where nodes are sensors and edges are communication links. The goal is to select a minimal set of sensors covering all links, formulated as a Minimum Vertex Cover Problem. Three algorithms—Greedy 2-approximation, LP-relaxation, and Randomized heuristic—are compared on synthetic networks in terms of sensor count, execution time, and coverage, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

2.Randomized and Probabilistic Vertex Cover Algorithms\
The Vertex Cover problem seeks the smallest set of vertices covering all edges and is NP-hard. The task is to design a randomized algorithm that repeatedly picks a random uncovered edge and adds one endpoint to the cover. Its performance is evaluated via multiple trials on random graphs, measuring average size, variance, and execution time, compared to deterministic methods, and extended for parallel execution on large networks.
