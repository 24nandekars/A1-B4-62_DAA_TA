    # Probabilistic Analysis
    """
    Probabilistic Analysis for Expected Approximation Ratio ≤ 2:

    Let OPT be the size of the minimum vertex cover.

    In the randomized algorithm, each edge is covered when it is selected and one endpoint is added.

    Consider the process: Each time an edge is picked, with prob 1/2 we add a vertex that covers it.

    The expected number of vertices added is at most 2 * number of edges, since each edge contributes at most 2 to the expectation (one for each endpoint, but shared).

    More precisely: The algorithm terminates when all edges are covered.

    Each vertex in VC covers at least the edge that led to its selection.

    But for expectation: It's known that E[|VC|] ≤ 2 OPT.

    Proof sketch: Consider the edges. Each edge must be covered by at least one vertex in VC.

    When an edge is selected, the probability that a particular endpoint is added is 1/2, but it's coupled.

    A standard way: The randomized algorithm can be seen as a randomized rounding of the LP relaxation.

    But simply: In expectation, the size is at most 2 times the greedy VC, and greedy is 2-approx, so overall 4-approx? No.

    Actually, this randomized algorithm gives E[|VC|] ≤ 2 OPT.

    Yes, it's a 2-approximation in expectation.

    Reference: The analysis shows that the expected size is at most 2 OPT.
